  - Documentation (README, folder structure, tech stack explanation)
  - Suggested design system and component hierarchy

- **Manual coding:** ~40%

  - Responsive tweaks for mobile/tablet views
  - Advanced filtering and pagination logic for the table

- **Customization:**
  - AI outputs were heavily adapted to match project branding and UX goals
  - Tailwind classes, component props, and design tokens were manually fine-tuned
  - Lovable‚Äôs UI mockups were iterated and adjusted using Figma and code
